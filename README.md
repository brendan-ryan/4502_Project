## Project Description

In this project, we imagine ourselves in the role of the streaming music provider, seeking to improve engagement by providing a feature to suggest new songs or artists for a user to listen to. Our primary goal is to provide suggested extensions to a playlist prompt. We are also curious about trends that may be discernable within the data, such as whether a song tends to appear at the beginning or end of a playlist, the likelihood for two songs to appear on the same playlist, or the degree to which a playlist has varied albums or artists will also be explored.

## Summary of Questions Sought and Answers

- Can we extend a playlist based on some prompt?
    - Yes, Apriori worked the best for us to determine a playlist extension. We were able to use the algorithm to determine a playlist extension with reasonable accuracy.
- Can we employ any other methods to build playlists based on a user prompt?
    - Yes, using Natural Language Processing, we can mine playlist titles to build a list of related songs based on the frequency of their occurrence among the candidate playlists.

## Application of this Knowledge

- The knowledge we gained can be applied to videos, where suggestions for video content can be made based on previously demonstrated interest.
- We can apply these techniques to shopping lists, where we can offer potential items for someone that may want to purchase or even pre-populate a shopping cart based on prior interests.
- We also see potential applications to social media, where we can suggest relationships based on similar interests.
